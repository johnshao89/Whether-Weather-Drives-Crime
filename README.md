# Whether-Weather-Drives-Crime
## Analytics with Python (Matplotlib, Pandas, and API Requests)
### Data Analytics Bootcamp - Project 1 - Group 7

#### Team Members
Minna Wu<br>
Tim Sutherland<br>
Wenjie Shao<br>
Gobind Singh<br>

#### Project Description 
We are interested in seeing whether there is a correlation between the weather and the number of major crimes commited. For this project, we decided to look at just the City of Toronto.
 
#### Research Questions to Answer 
Is there a correlation between weather and major crimes?<br>
- Temperature vs. crime
- Precipitation vs. crime
- Moon phase vs. crime
- Weekend or weekday vs. crime

#### Data Sets to be Used
2 APIs:
- MCI (Major Crime Indicators) 2014-2017 (http://data.torontopolice.on.ca/datasets/mci-2014-to-2017/geoservice)
- World Weather Online (https://www.worldweatheronline.com/developer/premium-api-explorer.aspx)

#### Rough Breakdown of Tasks
Everyone will be practicing the pulling and cleaning of both weather and crime data. Subsequently, we will each focus on one of the above four research questions, preparing Pandas dataframes, plotting the data, and analyzing the results.<br>

- Minna Wu: Temperature vs. Crime<br>
- Tim Sutherland: Moon Phase vs. Crime<br>
- Wenjie Shao: Precipitation vs. Crime<br>
- Gobind Singh: Weekday vs. Weekend Crime<br>
